FRAME Celebrates One Year of Innovation and Growth in Virtual Fiscalization

### Share:

Bulawayo, Zimbabwe — 17 October 2025

FRAME Virtual Fiscalisation, a leading provider of fiscalization and fiscal data management solutions in Zimbabwe, proudly marks its first anniversary. Since its launch in Bulawayo, the company has been at the forefront of digital fiscalization, helping businesses across the country simplify compliance with ZIMRA fiscal regulations through a seamless virtual platform.

Transforming Fiscalization in Zimbabwe

When FRAME was founded, its mission was clear — to provide an efficient, transparent, and compliant fiscalization solution that empowers businesses to strengthen confidence in Zimbabwe's taxation systems.

Unlike traditional fiscal devices, FRAME's system is entirely software-based, offering virtual fiscalization through desktop and mobile applications. This means companies can now fiscalize transactions remotely — without needing physical devices or manual paperwork.

### Our Vision:

"We aspired to be more than just a service provider. Our goal was to become a trusted partner for businesses and regulatory bodies like ZIMRA, ensuring compliance while reducing operational costs."

Innovation That Saves Time and Money

FRAME's virtual fiscal device (VFD) solution allows businesses to handle fiscalization digitally, saving both time and money. Installations can be done remotely — enabling businesses from any region in Zimbabwe to set up within an hour.

### Key Benefits:

### Easy to use:

Intuitive interface designed for businesses of all sizes

### In tune with the times:

Modern, cloud-based solution

### Highly efficient:

Streamlined processes reduce compliance time

### Affordable:

Significantly lower costs compared to traditional fiscal devices

### Minimal support required:

Self-service platform with comprehensive documentation

This innovative model has attracted a diverse range of businesses — from SMEs to established corporations — all seeking to modernize their fiscal processes and stay compliant with ZIMRA's fiscalization mandate.

Regulatory Support and Endorsement

At the anniversary celebration, a ZIMRA official commended FRAME for its contribution to enhancing fiscal compliance and transparency. The official emphasized that all businesses — including non-VAT registered entities — will soon be required to fiscalize, making FRAME's virtual solution essential for the future of tax compliance in Zimbabwe.

### Important Compliance Update:

"The penalties for non-compliance are heavy. FRAME's solution provides a simple, affordable, and compliant way for businesses to meet their tax obligations."

Bulawayo City Council Recognizes FRAME's Impact

The event was also attended by Bulawayo's Deputy Mayor, Councillor Godwin Glo, who highlighted the company's role in supporting the city's economic growth and job creation.

### Local Government Support:

"We are ready to work with innovative businesses like FRAME. Compliance opens doors to more business opportunities, and FRAME's system makes that possible for local entrepreneurs."

— Councillor Godwin Glo, Deputy Mayor of Bulawayo

A Milestone Worth Celebrating

The celebration culminated with the Deputy Mayor joining the FRAME team in cutting the anniversary cake, marking a year of success, innovation, and partnership between FRAME, its clients, and regulatory authorities.

As FRAME steps into its second year, the company remains dedicated to driving digital transformation and promoting fiscal transparency across Zimbabwe.
